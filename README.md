# Happy Day Dessert Factory Website

A website for Happy Day Dessert Factory, a new and exciting brand with 12+ years of experience in the frozen dessert industry.

## Project Description

This project is a web development assignment for the course Information Systems Milieux (67-250) at Carnegie Mellon University. The purpose of this project is to expand the front-end web design and development skills by creating a new version of the website for Happy Day Dessert Factory, a local business that serves premium homemade hard ice cream and other frozen desserts.

The new website aims to help customers learn more about the menu items, promotions, gift cards, location and contact information of the factory. It also provides a simplified but enhanced experience for visitors to navigate the website, search for menu items, and link to third-party sites to order food from the menu.

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the main technologies, and follows the requirements and expectations provided by the factory's management. Due to some project restrictions, this website is not optimized for responsiveness.
